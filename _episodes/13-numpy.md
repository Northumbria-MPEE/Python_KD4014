## Loading data into Python
In order to load our inflammation data, we need to access
([import]({{ page.root }}/reference/#import) in Python terminology) a library called
[NumPy](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/ "NumPy Documentation").  In general you should use this
library if you want to do fancy things with numbers, especially if you have matrices or arrays.  We
can import NumPy using:

First lets import the numpy library, and ask the library to read our cleaned data
file for us:

~~~
import numpy
numpy.loadtxt(fname='UVVis-01-cleaned.csv', delimiter=',')
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
array([[ 4.47125000e-04,  6.55591000e-04,  8.64056000e-04, ...,

       [-3.66223800e-03, -3.49741500e-03, -3.34321500e-03, ...,

       [ 2.23267300e-03,  2.29731000e-03,  2.47505900e-03, ...,

        -1.33138746e-01, -6.67433520e-02,  1.55003861e-01],

{: .output}

The expression `numpy.loadtxt(...)` is a [function call]({{ page.root }}/reference/#function-call)
that asks Python to run the [function]({{ page.root }}/reference/#function) `loadtxt` which
belongs to the `numpy` library. 

`numpy.loadtxt` has two [parameters]({{ page.root }}/reference/#parameter): the name of the file
we want to read and the [delimiter]({{ page.root }}/reference/#delimiter) that separates values on
a line. These both need to be character strings (or [strings]({{ page.root }}/reference/#string)
for short), so we put them in quotes.

Let's re-run
`numpy.loadtxt` and save the returned data:

~~~
data = numpy.loadtxt(fname='UVVis-01-cleaned.csv', delimiter=',')
~~~
{: .language-python}

Remember, this statement doesn't produce any output because we've assigned the output to the variable `data` (see the [pandas lesson]() for more details.
If we want to check that the data have been loaded,
we can print the variable's value:

~~~
print(data)
~~~
{: .language-python}

First,
let's ask what [type]({{ page.root }}/reference/#type) of thing `data` refers to:

~~~
print(type(data))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
<class 'numpy.ndarray'>
~~~
{: .output}

The output tells us that `data` currently refers to
an N-dimensional array, the functionality for which is provided by the NumPy library.
The rows are the individual samples, and the columns
are the absorption at each wavelength.

>

> of the same type. The `type` function will only tell you that

{: .callout}

With the following command, we can see the array's [shape]({{ page.root }}/reference/#shape):

~~~
print(data.shape)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
(10, 1301)
~~~
{: .output}

The output tells us that the `data` array variable contains 10 rows and 1301 columns. When we
created the variable `data` to store our absorption data, we didn't just create the array; we also
created information about the array, called [members]({{ page.root }}/reference/#member) or
attributes. This extra information describes `data` in the same way an adjective describes a noun.
`data.shape` is an attribute of `data` which describes the dimensions of `data`. We use the same
dotted notation for the attributes of variables that we use for the functions in libraries because
they have the same part-and-whole relationship.

If we want to get a single number from the array, we must provide an
[index]({{ page.root }}/reference/#index) in square brackets after the variable name, just as we
do in math when referring to an element of a matrix.  Our absorption data has two dimensions, so
we will need to use two indices to refer to one specific value:

~~~
print('first value in data:', data[0, 0])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
first value in data: 0.000447125
~~~
{: .output}

~~~
print('middle value in data:', data[5, 600])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
middle value in data: 0.05236074
~~~
{: .output}

The expression `data[5, 600]` accesses the element at row 5, column 600. While this expression may
not surprise you,
 `data[0, 0]` might.
Programming languages like Fortran, MATLAB and R start counting at 1
because that's what human beings have done for thousands of years.
Languages in the C family (including C++, Java, Perl, and Python) count from 0
because it represents an offset from the first value in the array (the second
value is offset by one index from the first value). This is closer to the way
that computers represent arrays (if you are interested in the historical
reasons behind counting indices from zero, you can read
[Mike Hoye's blog post](http://exple.tive.org/blarg/2013/10/22/citation-needed/)).
As a result,
if we have an MÃ—N array in Python,
its indices go from 0 to M-1 on the first axis
and 0 to N-1 on the second.
It takes a bit of getting used to,
but one way to remember the rule is that
the index is how many steps we have to take from the start to get the item we want.

{: .callout}

## Slicing data
An index like `[5, 600]` selects a single element of an array,
but we can select whole sections as well.
For example,
we can select the first ten days (columns) of values
for the first four patients (rows) like this:

~~~
print(data[0:4, 0:10])
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~

~~~
{: .output}

The [slice]({{ page.root }}/reference/#slice) `0:4` means, "Start at index 0 and go up to, but not
including, index 4."Again, the up-to-but-not-including takes a bit of getting used to, but the
rule is that the difference between the upper and lower bounds is the number of values in the slice.

We don't have to start slices at 0:

~~~

~~~
{: .output}

We also don't have to include the upper and lower bound on the slice.  If we don't include the lower
bound, Python uses 0 by default; if we don't include the upper, the slice runs to the end of the
axis, and if we don't include either (i.e., if we just use ':' on its own), the slice includes
everything:

~~~
small = data[:3, 36:]
print('small is:')
print(small)
~~~
{: .language-python}
The above example selects rows 0 through 2 and columns 36 through to the end of the array.

~~~
small is:

Arrays also know how to perform common mathematical operations on their values.  The simplest
operations with data are arithmetic: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  When you
do such operations on arrays, the operation is done element-by-element.  Thus:

~~~
doubledata = data * 2.0
~~~
{: .language-python}

will create a new array `doubledata`
each element of which is twice the value of the corresponding element in `data`:

~~~
print('original:')
print(data[:3, 36:])
print('doubledata:')
print(doubledata[:3, 36:])
~~~
{: .language-python}

If, instead of taking an array and doing arithmetic with a single value (as above), you did the
arithmetic operation with another array of the same shape, the operation will be done on
corresponding elements of the two arrays.  Thus:

~~~
tripledata = doubledata + data
~~~
{: .language-python}

will give you an array where `tripledata[0,0]` will equal `doubledata[0,0]` plus `data[0,0]`,
and so on for all other elements of the arrays.

~~~

print(tripledata[:3, 36:])

Often, we want to do more than add, subtract, multiply, and divide array elements.  NumPy knows how
to do more complex operations, too.  If we want to find the average absorption for all samples across all wavelengths, for example, we can ask NumPy to compute `data`'s mean value:

~~~
print(numpy.mean(data))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
0.0814548568076864
~~~
{: .output}

`mean` is a [function]({{ page.root }}/reference/#function) that takes
an array as an [argument]({{ page.root }}/reference/#argument).

NumPy has lots of useful functions that take an array as input.
Let's use three of those functions to get some descriptive values about the dataset.
We'll also use multiple assignment,
a convenient Python feature that will enable us to do this all in one line.

~~~
maxval, minval, stdval = numpy.max(data), numpy.min(data), numpy.std(data)

print('maximum absorption:', maxval)
print('minimum absorption:', minval)
print('standard deviation:', stdval)
~~~
{: .language-python}

Here we've assigned the return value from `numpy.max(data)` to the variable `maxval`, the value
from `numpy.min(data)` to `minval`, and so on.

~~~
maximum absorption: 10.0
minimum absorption: -1.036568046
standard deviation: 0.24849228257073133

{: .callout}

When analyzing data, though,
we often want to look at variations in statistical values,
such as the maximum absorption per sample
or the average absorption per wavelength.
One way to do this is to create a new temporary array of the data we want,
then ask it to do the calculation:

~~~
sample_0 = data[0, :] # 0 on the first axis (rows), everything on the second (columns)
print('maximum absorption for sample 0:', sample_0.max())
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
maximum absorption for sample 0: 10.0
~~~
{: .output}

Everything in a line of code following the '#' symbol is a
[comment]({{ page.root }}/reference/#comment) that is ignored by Python.
Comments allow programmers to leave explanatory notes for other
programmers or their future selves.

We don't actually need to store the row in a variable of its own.
Instead, we can combine the selection and the function call:

~~~
print('maximum absorption for sample 2:', numpy.max(data[2, :]))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
maximum absorption for sample 2: 0.37719923299999997
~~~
{: .output}

What if we need the maximum absorption for each patient over all wavelengths (as in the
next diagram on the left) or the average for each wavelength (as in the
diagram on the right)? As the diagram below shows, we want to perform the
operation across an axis:

![Operations Across Axes](../fig/python-operations-across-axes.png)

To support this functionality,
most array functions allow us to specify the axis we want to work on.
If we ask for the average across axis 0 (rows in our 2D example),
we get:

~~~
print(numpy.mean(data, axis=0))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
[0.00556981 0.00575402 0.00588247 ... 1.07087656 0.34124763 0.27600167]
~~~
{: .output}

As a quick check,
we can ask this array what its shape is:

~~~
print(numpy.mean(data, axis=0).shape)
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
(1301,)
~~~
{: .output}

The expression `(1301,)` tells us we have an NÃ—1 vector,
so this is the average absorption per day for all samples.
If we average across axis 1 (columns in our 2D example), we get:

~~~
print(numpy.mean(data, axis=1))
~~~
{: .language-python}

~~~
[0.13104075 0.02947129 0.02323768 0.08578812 0.07745822 0.10012283
 0.10339795 0.09871813 0.08216419 0.08314941]
~~~
{: .output}

which is the average absorption per sample across all wavelengths.

> > A 'gotcha' with array indexing is that singleton dimensions
> > are dropped by default. That means `A[:, 0]` is a one dimensional
> > array, which won't stack as desired. To preserve singleton dimensions,
> > the index itself can be a slice or array. For example, `A[:, :1]` returns
> > a two dimensional array with one singleton dimension (i.e. a column
> > vector).
