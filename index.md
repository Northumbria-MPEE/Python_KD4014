This lesson is an introduction to programming in Python
for people with little or no previous programming experience.
It uses plotting as its motivating example.
This lesson references the Jupyter Notebook,
but can be taught using a regular Python interpreter as well.
Please note that this lesson uses Python 3 rather than Python 2.

This lesson is adapted from the [Imperial College London lesson](https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/python-novice-mix/), which was designed to be used in [Software Carpentry]({{ site.swc_site }}) workshops.
