This lesson is an introduction to programming in Python
for people with little or no previous programming experience.
It uses plotting UV-Vis data as its motivating example.
This lesson references the Jupyter Notebook,
but can be taught using a regular Python interpreter as well.
Please note that this lesson uses Python 3 rather than Python 2.

This lesson is adapted from the [Imperial College London lesson](https://imperialcollegelondon.github.io/python-novice-mix/), which was designed to be used in [Software Carpentry]({{ site.swc_site }}) workshops.
