This is an introduction to Python for non-programmers based on content from
the two software carpentry courses:
[python-novice-gapminder][python-novice-gapminder] and
[python-novice-inflammation][python-novice-inflammation]. It has been adapted
for use with scientists in the physical sciences, using UVVis data as a motivating example.
