    "- How can I use software that other people have written?\n",
    "- How can I find out what that software does?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objectives**\n",
    "- Explain what software libraries are and why the programmers create them.\n",
    "- Write programs that import and use libraries from Python's standard library.\n",
    "- Find and read documentation for standard libraries interactively (in the interpreter) and online.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Most of the power of a programming language is in its libraries.\n",
    "Importing a library is like getting a piece of lab equipment out of a storage locker and setting it up on the bench. Libraries provide additional functionality to the basic Python package, much like a new piece of equipment adds functionality to a lab space. Just like in the lab, importing too many libraries can sometimes complicate and slow down your programs - so we only import what we need for each program.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A _library_ is a collection of files (called _modules_) that contains functions for use by other functions.\n",
    "    - May also contain data values (_e.g._, numerical constants) and other things.\n",
    "    - Library's contents are supposed to be related, but there's no way to enforce that.\n",
    "- The Python [standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/) is an extensive suite of modules that comes iwth Python itself.}~\n",
    "- Many additional libraries are available from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/) (the Python Package Index)\n",
    "- We will see later how to write new libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Libraries and modules\n",
    "A library is a collection of modules, but the terms are often used interchangably, especially since many libraries only consist of a single module, so don't worry if you mix them.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A program must import a library module before using it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use `import` to load a library into a program's memory.\n",
    "- We can then refer to things from the module as `module_name.thing_name`. For example, using `math`, one of the modules in the standard library:"
